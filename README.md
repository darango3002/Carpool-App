# Carpool-App

A full stack web application that allows users to organize carpooling rides with their friends and group members.
The application will automatically find the fastest route for pickup up all passengers

Currently a personal project in development for clubs at the University of Florida and is being run locally.

Users can:
- Join groups to find rides within their groups
- Create rides from one location to a destination
- Request to join a ride from a specific location
- Accept users to join a ride
